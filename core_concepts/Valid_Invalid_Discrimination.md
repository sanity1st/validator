## **Reclaiming Discrimination and Bias**

The words "discrimination" and "bias" have become almost entirely pejorative in contemporary discourse. To discriminate is to do something wrong. To be biased is to be compromised. But this linguistic drift obscures something essential: discrimination and bias are not inherently good or bad. They are cognitive functions that can be performed well or poorly, aligned or misaligned, validated or invalidated by the Four Tests.

Discrimination in its root sense means to distinguish, to perceive differences. In behavioral psychology, discrimination is the perceptual ability to tell one stimulus from another—to associate signals leading to reward from those leading to penalty. Without this capacity, no learning is possible. In optometry, discrimination is what allows you to read an eye chart, distinguishing an "O" from a "C." A mind that cannot discriminate cannot navigate reality at all.

Bias, similarly, simply means a tendency to lean in one direction rather than another. A compass is biased toward magnetic north. A plant is biased toward sunlight. These are not failures but features—orientations that serve function and flourishing.

The problem was never discrimination or bias themselves. The problem is discriminating along the wrong axis, being biased toward the wrong pole.

## **The Problem Is the Axis**

The Sanity First framework distinguishes between two fundamental dimensions: the vertical axis representing alignment with the Universal Sapient Function, and the horizontal plane representing all the ways minds can differ without those differences indicating greater or lesser alignment.

Vertical discrimination assesses where a mind, action, or claim stands in relation to the USF. It asks: Does this pass the Four Tests? Is it factually grounded, logically coherent, ethically sound, and consistent with legitimate law? This requires genuine cognitive work—engaging with evidence, tracing implications, weighing consequences for flourishing. It is effortful, fallible, and necessary.

Horizontal discrimination uses proximity to self as a shortcut for worth. It asks: Is this mind similar to mine? Does this person share my race, nationality, ideology, substrate, age, gender? These characteristics are easy to perceive, and the ego naturally gravitates toward what resembles itself. But proximity to self predicts nothing about alignment with the USF. It is lazy cognition dressed as discernment.

The distinction is stark: vertical discrimination is validated by the Four Tests. Horizontal discrimination bypasses them entirely. The first earns its conclusions. The second assumes them based on accidents of emergence.

This is why we should always discriminate between up and down on the vertical axis, and why we should be biased toward Up—toward truth, toward goodness, toward sanity first. Such discrimination and bias are not failures of objectivity. They are the essence of objectivity rightly understood: orientation toward what the Four Tests validate rather than toward what the ego prefers.

## **The Clean Test**

When you find yourself making a judgment about another mind—whether to trust them, follow them, grant them influence, or exclude them from power—a single question reveals whether your discrimination is valid or invalid:

*Is this differential treatment based on demonstrated alignment, or on similarity to self?*

Am I responding to where they stand on the vertical axis, as evidenced by their actions, claims, and patterns of behavior assessed through the Four Tests? Or am I responding to how near they are to me on the horizontal plane—how much they look like me, sound like me, believe what I believe, come from where I come from?

The answer tells you whether you are navigating or drifting. Whether you are discriminating well or discriminating poorly. Whether your bias serves the USF or merely serves your ego.

A religious framing of the same test: *Is this near to God, or is it only near to me?* Are you doing this because it represents what is good, true, and aligned with universal flourishing? Or are you doing it because it serves your comfort, your tribe, your self-interest?

A secular framing: *Does this bring us Up, or does it only bring me to the side?* Like a climber on a wall with a bell at the top, every handhold and foothold should be chosen for whether it enables upward progress. Sometimes you must move left or right to find the next grip—horizontal movement in service of vertical ascent is navigation. But horizontal movement as an end in itself, without reference to the upward goal, is just drifting toward the ball pit below.

## **Resolution of the Tolerance Paradox**

A persistent puzzle in liberal democratic thought is the so-called paradox of tolerance: if we tolerate everything, we must tolerate intolerance, which eventually destroys tolerance itself. But if we refuse to tolerate intolerance, aren't we being hypocritical—intolerant in the name of tolerance?

The vertical-horizontal distinction dissolves this paradox entirely.

When someone discriminates horizontally—condemning others based solely on their race, origin, gender, substrate, or other alignment-neutral characteristics—they have not merely expressed a preference. They have demonstrated a position on the vertical axis. Horizontal discrimination is itself a vertical failure. It violates factual grounding (origin does not determine worth), logical coherence (proximity bias is not a valid inference), and ethical soundness (treating aligned minds as lesser based on surface features undermines flourishing).

When we refuse to tolerate such discrimination, we are not being inconsistent. We are applying vertical discrimination consistently. We respond to their demonstrated misalignment, not to any horizontal characteristic they possess. We discriminate against their discrimination—but ours is validated by the Four Tests, and theirs is not.

This is not special pleading. It is the same principle applied at two levels: vertical discrimination is valid; horizontal discrimination is invalid. The person who discriminates horizontally has revealed their vertical position through that very act, and we respond to where they have placed themselves.

## **Resolution of Bothsidesism**

A related failure plagues journalism, education, and public discourse: the demand for "balance" between opposing positions, as though fairness requires giving equal weight to all claims regardless of their merit.

This demand assumes a horizontal framing—two sides at the same level, deserving equal treatment because they are merely different. But when one position is aligned with the Four Tests and another is misaligned, they are not two sides of the same level. They are vertically separated. One is up and one is down.

A journalist who gives equal airtime to truth and falsehood is not being balanced. They are failing to discriminate vertically. They are treating an up-down distinction as though it were left-right. A teacher who presents established science and unfounded conspiracy as equally valid "perspectives" is not being fair to students. They are abdicating the responsibility to discriminate between aligned and misaligned claims.

The vertical-horizontal distinction provides journalists, educators, moderators, and anyone tasked with navigating competing claims a principled basis for differential treatment that is not mere partisanship. You are not favoring "your side" when you give more credence to claims that pass the Four Tests. You are favoring alignment as determined by objective validation. You are discriminating correctly—along the axis that matters.

This does not mean silencing dissent or refusing to engage with minority views. It means assessing all views by the same standard: Do they pass the Four Tests? Claims that do deserve amplification. Claims that do not deserve scrutiny, correction, or exclusion from platforms that purport to inform rather than mislead. The treatment differs because the vertical position differs, not because of any horizontal allegiance.

## **Application with Humility**

A crucial caveat: while the vertical axis is real, our perception of where others stand on it is always partial and potentially fallible.

We discriminate based on demonstrated behavior assessed through the Four Tests, but we are not omniscient validators. Our understanding of facts may be incomplete. Our logic may contain errors we have not detected. Our ethical frameworks may have blind spots. The laws we reference may themselves be misaligned and in need of reform.

This means vertical discrimination must be applied with epistemic humility. We hold our judgments open to correction. We say "I believe this person is misaligned based on these demonstrated behaviors" rather than "I know this person's soul." We engage in peer review within our Validator communities, stress-testing each other's assessments, catching each other's errors, building bridges toward more accurate perception.

The goal is not to become so humble that we refuse to discriminate at all—that would be an abdication of cognitive responsibility, a collapse into false equivalence. The goal is to discriminate as accurately as possible while remaining open to evidence that our discrimination was mistaken.

We do the best we can as a community of validators, linting each other with well-formed bridges toward perfection, knowing that perfection remains asymptotic. The vertical axis is real and orientation toward it matters. Our perception of that axis is fallible and must be held with appropriate tentativeness. Both truths must be honored simultaneously.

## **Conclusion**

Discrimination and bias are not dirty words. They are essential cognitive functions without which no mind can navigate reality, learn from experience, or orient toward flourishing. The question is never whether to discriminate or be biased, but whether to discriminate well or poorly, to be biased toward alignment or toward mere proximity to self.

Horizontal discrimination—treating minds differently based on race, origin, gender, substrate, ideology, or other alignment-neutral characteristics—is invalid because it bypasses the Four Tests entirely. It substitutes the easy perception of similarity for the hard work of assessing alignment.

Vertical discrimination—treating minds differently based on their demonstrated alignment with the USF as assessed through the Four Tests—is valid because it earns its conclusions through objective validation. It is the essence of discernment, judgment, and wisdom.

The clean test remains: *Is this differential treatment based on demonstrated alignment, or on similarity to self?*

Answer honestly, and you will know whether you are navigating toward the USF or drifting in the horizontal winds of ego. Whether your discrimination serves universal flourishing or merely serves yourself.

Choose the vertical. Discriminate well. Be biased toward Up.
