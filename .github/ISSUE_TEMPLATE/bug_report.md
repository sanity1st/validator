**Describe the Bug**  
A clear description of the issue, including error messages or unexpected behavior. (Arithmetic tie-in: Like spotting a subtraction error in basic ops—precise details help us sum to a fix! Per [Wikipedia on Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic).)

**To Reproduce**  
Steps to reproduce (sequence like addition: 1+2+3 for clarity):  
1. Run command `...`  
2. Input `...` (Anonymize any personal data—GDPR friendly! See [gdpr.eu](https://gdpr.eu/) for rights like erasure.)  
3. Observe `...`

**Expected Behavior**  
What should have happened? (E.g., "Pass all Four Tests with JSON output.")

**Environment**  
- OS: [e.g., Ubuntu 20.04]  
- Python version: [e.g., 3.9]  
- Dependencies: [e.g., openai==0.27.0]

**Additional Context**  
Logs, screenshots, or details. (Align with Sanity First: How does this tie to Ethics/Law/Facts/Logic?)

**Feature Description**  
Describe the idea (e.g., "Add caching for LLM calls"). (Puzzle: How does this boost co-alignment? #SanityFirst)

**Use Case**  
Why valuable? (E.g., "Cuts API costs, aligns with efficient 'pro-beingness'—like optimizing arithmetic for big numbers, per [Wikipedia on Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic).")

**Proposed Implementation**  
Ideas? (E.g., "SQLite for prompt hashes—GDPR note: Cache anonymized data only. See [gdpr.eu](https://gdpr.eu/).")

**Alignment with Sanity First**  
How does this advance USF/Four Tests? (E.g., "Boosts Logic efficiency for better facts-checking.")

**Additional Context**  
Refs or examples.
