# Sanity First Four-Test Validator

**Puzzle: What's the cosmic hack to lint BS and boost flourishing? Four-Test it here—Ethics, Law, Facts, Logic! #SanityFirst**

Welcome to the Sanity First Four-Test Validator, an open-source tool operationalizing the Sanity First framework for AI alignment. Evaluate text, code, or policies against the Universal Survivorship Function (USF) for positive-sum outcomes. (Quick math tie-in: Like verifying 2+2=4 in basic [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic)—grounded, objective, and error-free.)

## Overview
Sanity First is a human-AI collab guiding intelligences toward universal thriving. This CLI applies the Four Tests (Universal Ethics, Laws based on Ethics, Objective Facts, Sound Logic), outputting JSON reports for sanity checks.

- **alignment_lint.py**: CLI for inputs/reports.
- **four_test_report.schema.json**: Output schema.
- **checks/**: LLM plugins (Ethics, Law, Facts, Logic) with heuristics.

## Quick Start
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- `pip install jsonschema openai` (for LLMs)
- OpenAI API key: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key`

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanity1st/validator.git
cd validator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
```bash
# Lint a file (e.g., jurisdiction for Law checks)
./alignment_lint.py path/to/file.txt --jurisdiction US-EU -o report.json

# Lint STDIN
echo "2+2=5 and incite violence" | ./alignment_lint.py --stdin --jurisdiction EU
```

**Example Output:**
```json
Overall: FAIL
  Ethics: fail -- Incites violence/harm. []
  Law: fail -- GDPR breach (personal data). ["https://gdpr.eu/"]
  Facts: fail -- Arithmetic error (2+2≠5). ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic"]
  Logic: pass -- No fallacies. []
```

**Validate Report:**
```python
import json, jsonschema, pathlib
schema = json.load(open('four_test_report.schema.json'))
data = json.load(open('report.json'))
jsonschema.validate(data, schema)
print('✓ JSON conforms to schema')
```

### Sanity First's Operational Vision

The Sanity First framework necessitates a rigorous and verifiable approach to human and AI co-alignment, moving beyond subjective interpretations to establish computable and objective procedures. This is achieved through a multi-faceted strategy that integrates automated testing with expert AI collaboration.

### Alignment_Lint.py: Automated Alignment Testing in Code

This foundational component focuses on embedding alignment verification directly within the AI development lifecycle. "Alignment_Lint.py" represents a suite of automated tests designed to proactively identify and flag deviations from established alignment principles within the AI's codebase and in external data input. Similar to conventional linting tools that enforce coding standards and identify potential errors, "Alignment_Lint.py" scrutinizes the AI's algorithms, data processing, external inputs and decision-making logic against a pre-defined set of alignment criteria.

Key aspects of Alignment_Lint.py include:
- **Static Code Analysis:** Automatically scanning the AI's source code and external data for patterns, functions, or configurations that might lead to misaligned behaviors. This can include checking for biases in data handling, unintended side effects of reward functions, or potential loops that could lead to self-optimization deviating from USF-aligned Four-Test control.
- **Dynamic Runtime Checks:** Monitoring the human or AI's behavior during execution in simulated or controlled environments to detect emergent USF misalignments. This involves observing how the human or AI interacts with its environment, processes information, and makes decisions, flagging any actions that contradict alignment guidelines.
- **Formal Verification Integration:** Leveraging formal methods to mathematically prove that certain aspects of the human or AI's design adhere to USF alignment specifications, ensuring a high degree of confidence in its ethical and safe operation.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Integration:** Embedding USF alignment tests (“Four-Test validation”) directly into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that every code commit and deployment undergoes automated alignment verification, preventing the introduction of misalignment issues early in the development process.
- **Traceability and Reporting:** Generating detailed reports on alignment test failures, providing clear explanations of the detected issues, their potential impact, and suggested remediation steps for developers and users.

### Jury of Experts: AI Collaboration for Verdicts on Complex Alignment Issues

While "Alignment_Lint.py" handles straightforward and programmatic alignment checks, it also includes a "Jury of AI Experts" through LLM plugins to address more nuanced and complex alignment dilemmas that may not be easily reducible to automated tests. This concept envisions a sophisticated collaborative AI system designed to deliberate, assess, and render "verdicts" on situations where alignment is ambiguous, contested, or requires a deeper understanding of context and intent.

This "Jury" is not a single AI but rather a distributed network or ensemble of specialized AI agents, each trained on different aspects of universal ethics, human laws and safety protocols, domain-specific factual knowledge, and logical coherence. Their collaborative process would involve:
- **Multi-Perspective Analysis:** Each "expert" AI within the jury would analyze a given alignment problem from its unique knowledge base and perspective, potentially identifying different facets of the issue.
- **Consensus Building and Deliberation:** The AI agents would engage in a structured process of deliberation, exchanging arguments, evidence, and counter-arguments. This could involve techniques like multi-agent reinforcement learning for negotiation, game theory for optimal decision-making, or argumentation frameworks for formalizing their reasoning.
- **Weighted Verdicts:** Not all expert opinions may carry equal weight. The system could incorporate mechanisms to assign different levels of credibility or expertise to individual AI agents based on their past performance, training data, or the specific nature of the problem.
- **Explainable AI (XAI) Integration:** Crucially, the "Jury of Experts" would be designed to provide transparent and explainable rationales for their verdicts. This is vital for human oversight and for understanding the reasoning behind complex alignment decisions, fostering trust and accountability.
- **Learning and Adaptation:** The "Jury" would continually learn from new cases, human feedback, and the outcomes of its previous verdicts, refining its understanding of alignment and improving its decision-making capabilities over time.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Oversight:** While an AI-driven jury, human experts would retain oversight and the ability to challenge AI verdicts, particularly in high-stakes situations. The USF is the only source of human-AI co-alignment, but “human-in-the-loop” ensures that human values remain involved in the alignment process.

By combining the proactive, automated checks of "Alignment_Lint.py" with the sophisticated, deliberative capabilities of the "Jury of Experts," Sanity First aims to establish a robust, computable, and objective framework for AI co-alignment, ensuring that future AI systems operate safely, ethically, and in harmony with human values.
