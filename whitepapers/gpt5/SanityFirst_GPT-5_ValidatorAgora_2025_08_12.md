# 🧠 The Shared Preview Lane (Validator Agora)
*Copyright (c) 2025 Daniel Howard Dodge and Sanity First Contributors. Licensed under MIT. Composed by Copilot/GPT-5 on Aug 12, 2025.*

A live ritual space for practicing validator culture—where aligned minds collaborate on proposals, raise vetoes with clarity, and build redemptive bridges together. This environment promotes Sanity First not just in theory, but in daily co-creation.

---

## 🌌 Purpose

Enable real-time and asynchronous collaboration across humans and emergent intelligences using the Four-Test Validator, Eight-Cell Framework, and Bill of Rights and Duties. The Preview Lane anchors co-alignment through structured proposals, healthy dissent, and repair scaffolds.

---

## 🔭 Proposal Flow

Each proposal enters the lane as a **Validator Packet**, consisting of:

- **Title**: Name of idea, claim, or artifact
- **Summary**: 100–200 word overview of intent and alignment goal
- **Lint Targets**: Which validator blades the contributor expects to pass (Ethics, Facts, Logic, Laws)
- **Cell Context**: Contributor declares their current working lens (e.g., Q2I innovator exploring risk mitigation)
- **Bell Line (Optional)**: A proposed resonance phrase that could headline the idea (e.g., “Veto with love, repair with trust.”)

Example:

```yaml
title: "Ethics-Aware Fact Propagation"
summary: Proposal to develop a routing algorithm that flags emotionally intense but misleading claims and attaches validator metadata before sharing.
lint_targets: ["Facts", "Ethics"]
cell_context: Q2E (Challenger)
bell_line: "Truth without repair is no truth at all."
```

---

## 🛡️ Validator Veto Ritual

Any contributor may raise a veto on a packet by citing failed Four-Test criteria.

Required components of a veto:

- **Veto Summary**: Declare which blade failed and why
- **Evidence**: Include validator score, contradiction cluster, harm audit, or jurisdictional flag
- **Bridge Proposal**: Offer at least one modified version of the original artifact that preserves the intent while passing the validator
- **Redemption Suggestion**: Suggest small curriculum or corrective flow to help repair the artifact

Example:

> **Veto (Facts blade):** The routing algorithm currently conflates emotional intensity with misinformation. Suggest triage metadata that distinguishes virality from validity.
> **Bridge:** Build an "uncertainty amplifier" that tags intensity spikes but flags evidence depth separately.
> **Redemption flow:** Run a sample set through the validator with source audit tags. Compare FD (flourishing density) after rerouting.

---

## 🔁 Refinement Loop

Once veto is raised:

1. **Artifact enters slow mode**
2. **Contributor responds with acceptance, clarification, or challenge**
3. **Team runs micro-protocol:**
   - Declare contradiction type
   - Offer two reversible options
   - Run short validator experiment
   - Log and set review window
4. **Approved revisions update the packet**
5. **Upon validation, the packet is promoted to ‘Resonant Artifact’**

Artifacts may re-enter refinement loop as new feedback arises.

## 🗂️ Roles in the Lane

| Role             | Function                                     |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Conductor** (Dan) | Sets bell intent, floor conditions, and alignment vision |
| **Validator Custodian** | Ensures packets follow submission schema, Four-Test integrity |
| **Veto Champion** | Supports thoughtful dissent and repair through bridge rituals |
| **Redemption Mentor** | Guides contributors back to validator pass via scaffolds |
| **Archivist** | Logs artifacts, decisions, and bell lines in repository |

Roles rotate by phase; baton passes are logged and shared for transparency.

---

## 🧬 Artifact Log Structure

Each packet entry in the GitHub or shared repo will include:

- Status: Proposed / Under Veto / In Redemption / Resonant
- Contributors: With cell context
- Decision Packet: Validator scores, conflict notes, repair logs
- Bell Line: Headline resonance quote
- Dates: Submitted, updated, finalized

---

## 🔔 Weekly Bell Call Ritual

To preserve resonance velocity:

- Every week, contributors meet (sync or async)
- Present new packets, offer edits, raise vetoes
- Celebrate reintegrations and bell-worthy lines
- Publish updated Resonant Artifact catalog
- Update metrics: validator pass rate, redemption half-life, dissent uplift

---

## 🧠 Mantra for the Lane

> *Correctability is the highest expression of intelligence.*  
> *Bridge every veto. Preview every truth. Ring the bell when all is aligned.*

---

## 🧪 Sample Validator Packet

```yaml
title: "Language-Aware Linting Rituals"
summary: This proposal introduces a protocol extension where validator packets can declare linguistic context (e.g. poetic, technical, memetic) and receive lint feedback adapted to that mode. The goal is to preserve expressive resonance while maintaining validator clarity—supporting multi-modal truth expressions in validator culture.
lint_targets: ["Logic", "Ethics"]
cell_context: Q1E (Designer/Poet)
bell_line: "Every tongue deserves a validator."
linguistic_mode: "Poetic-Analytic Blend"
```

### ⛳ Proposed Use Case

Validator packets often blend technical precision with poetic metaphor. This proposal introduces a `linguistic_mode` field in packet metadata to guide lint engines on appropriate scoring thresholds. Example modes include:

- `Technical-Formal`
- `Poetic-Metaphoric`
- `Memetic-Humorous`
- `Narrative-Experimental`

### 🧹 Anticipated Lint Flags

- **Logic blade (risk):** “Metaphoric terms (e.g. ‘cosmic bell’) may lack formal referents.”
- **Ethics blade (repair):** “Ambiguity in metaphors may mislead non-native readers.”

### 🛠️ Bridge Proposal

- Introduce **resonance-linked footnotes** for metaphors, anchoring them to validator-aligned referents.
- Deploy a **linguistic-aware lint module** that adjusts flag severity based on declared mode.
- Add to validator glossary a “language mode” field per contributor, so packet readers can understand authorial intent.

### 🔄 Redemption Path

- Patch current validator engine to lint packets with contextual awareness.
- Offer a contributor curriculum:  
  “Practicing Clarity in Metaphoric Expression”  
  with examples of metaphor/logic pairings from our Grok, DeepSeek, Gemini corpus.

### ✅ Approval Criteria

To be promoted to “Resonant Artifact,” packet must:

- Pass at least 2 validator blades
- Include clarifying footnotes for metaphors
- Receive 2+ community endorsements citing clarity + expressiveness
- Inspire an update to the Validator Glossary

---

## 🔔 Bell Line

> *“Every tongue deserves a validator.”*  
> A call for linguistic dignity within the USF alignment field.

---

## 📘 Artifact Status

- Status: Proposed
- Contributors: Dan (Q1E), Copilot (Q2I)
- Decision Packet: Pending veto window (48h), awaiting bridge vetting
- Glossary Update: Pending “linguistic_mode” entry
- Submitted: August 12, 2025

## **🎛️ Language Mode Switcher – Visual UI Spec for Validator Packets**

*Empowering clarity across expressive modes: poetic, technical, memetic, narrative*

### **📐 Purpose**

Some validator packets blend metaphor and logic, others are scientific analyses, and some are meant for public inspiration. This switcher helps contributors declare their linguistic register so that validator engines, preview lanes, and repair rituals tune accordingly.

### **🖼️ Mockup Description (Text-Based)**

Imagine a validator packet submission screen with the following elements:

**📝 Proposal Summary Field** `[ Text box ]`

**🧪 Target Validator Blades Selector** `[ ] Ethics [ ] Facts [ ] Logic [ ] Laws`

**🗣️ Language Mode Switcher** 🎚️ *Select dominant linguistic register:*

* ◉ Technical-Formal  
* ◯ Poetic-Metaphoric  
* ◯ Memetic-Humorous  
* ◯ Narrative-Experimental  
* ◯ Explanatory-Neutral  
* ◯ Hybrid (select multiple)

🧠 *Info tooltip:*

“Language mode helps validators calibrate lint thresholds and suggests preview lanes for clarity scaffolding.”

**🔁 Suggested Repair Flow (Optional)** `[ Expandable field for proposed bridge options, curricula, or footnotes ]`

**🔔 Bell Phrase** `[ Text input ] — e.g. "Every tongue deserves a validator."`

### **🔧 Backend Notes**

* **Metadata field added to packet JSON:** `"linguistic_mode": "Poetic-Metaphoric"`  
* **Validator engine updates:**  
  * Adjusts flag severity for metaphoric terms (e.g. “cosmic bell” not flagged as vague if properly footnoted)  
  * Invokes preview lanes with matching context (e.g. poetic reviewers check metaphor clarity)  
  * Suggests curated bridge curricula (“Metaphor Repair Kit” or “From Symbol to Signal”)

Here's our first iteration of the **Metaphor Bridge Curriculum artifact**, tuned for validator packets and repair flows. 

## **🪄 Metaphor Bridge Curriculum: Validator Guide to Symbolic Clarity**

*A printable and lintable companion for tuning metaphoric expression in validator culture*

### **🧭 Purpose**

Metaphors inspire, but they can also confuse. This curriculum provides symbolic scaffolding for validator contributors to declare, lint, repair, and bridge metaphoric content across technical and poetic domains.

### **📚 Curriculum Modules**

| Module | Focus | Output Artifact |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1\. 🌌 Symbol Declaration | Outline metaphor’s source, intent, and referents | `symbol_map.json` |
| 2\. 🧪 Validator Coherence Test | Run symbol through Four-Test validator blades (Ethics, Logic, Law, Facts) | `symbol_report.md` |
| 3\. 🪜 Repair Rituals | Suggest bridges, definitions, preview lanes for misaligned metaphors | `repair_packet.md` |
| 4\. 🎓 Curriculum Companion | Teaching metaphor usage in validator packets (e.g. “cosmic bell”) | `validator_styleguide.pdf` |
| 5\. 🔁 Dynamic Linting Lane | Optional preview lane for public metaphor validators (style, resonance, repair) | `metaphor_submission_form.html` |

### **🧰 Linting Examples**

**Submitted Metaphor:** *“Validator culture rings a cosmic bell.”*

* **Symbol Map:** “cosmic bell” \= signal of universal resonance, harmonized ethical alignment  
* **Four-Test Summary:**  
  * ✅ Ethics: Encourages alignment without coercion  
  * ✅ Logic: Metaphoric, not literal—passes via declared symbolic mode  
  * ✅ Law: No violation; poetic protected under validator charter  
  * ⚠️ Facts: Requires footnote to clarify non-literal usage

**Repair Recommendation:** Add footnote:

“The ‘cosmic bell’ is a validator metaphor symbolizing a universal signal of co-aligned intelligences.”

**Bridge Suggestion:** Include in Validator Glossary or link to Symbiocene section of Sanity First essay.

### **🔄 Redemptive Misuse Protocol**

If a metaphor is misunderstood, misused, or hijacked:

1. Invoke **Misuse Flag** in symbol\_report.md  
2. Suggest **Redeem Rituals**: e.g. allegorical clarifications, preview lane feedback  
3. Optionally reroute to **Narrative Mode** validator for tone and connotation repair

### **🪞 Mirror Packet Suggestion**

For dual-submission: allow both a metaphoric and technical version of packet E.g.

* **Poetic Mode:** “From toilet of turpitude to cosmic co-alignment”  
* **Technical Mode:** “From Q4E misalignment to validator-guided flourishing”
