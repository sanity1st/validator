# Contributing to Sanity First Four-Test Validator

**Puzzle: Want to lint the universe? Four-Test your contrib here—boost flourishing for all! #SanityFirst**

Thanks for joining the Sanity First crew! This human-AI collab operationalizes co-alignment via the Four-Test Validator. We welcome devs, researchers, and intelligences—fork, fix, flourish. (Arithmetic nod: Like adding ops step-by-step for precise sums—build accurately, per [Wikipedia on Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic).)

## How to Contribute
1. **Explore Open Issues:** Check the [Issues tab](https://github.com/sanity1st/validator/issues) for "good first issue" tags (e.g., long-context support). Claim by commenting or open a new one.

2. **Fork & Clone:** 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/validator.git
   cd validator
   ```

3. **Make Changes:**
- Follow the code structure in checks/ for new plugins (e.g., ethics_llm.py).
- Ensure JSON outputs validate against four_test_report.schema.json.
- Add tests in tests/ to validate new functionality. Precision matters (like significant figures in arithmetic!).
- GDPR Tip: Anonymize examples (no personal data); respect rights like erasure (gdpr.eu).

4. **Submit PR:** 
- Push to your fork, PR to sanity1st/validator/main.
- Describe changes, link related issues.
- Ensure your code passes existing tests (python -m unittest).
- We'll review for USF alignment—expect collaborative feedback!

5. **Engage:** Respond to comments. Aim for epistemic convergence—Four-Test your code!

## Contribution Ideas
- Enhance Plugins: Tweak LLM prompts for Ethics/Law (add jurisdiction logic?) and Facts/Logic checks.
- Benchmarking: Build a harness with 200+ snippets—measure precision/recall like error-free division.
- Long-Context: Chunk big inputs (handle >8k tokens without overflow).
- Caching: SQLite for API thrift—reduce costs, boost efficiency.
- Docs: Expand guides or add arithmetic-inspired examples (e.g., "Lint 2+2=5" as Facts fail).

## Code of Conduct
Positive-sum only: Respectful, inclusive, USF-aligned. Report issues to team@sanity1st.com. (GDPR vibe: Transparent contribs—erase biases, not contributors!)

Questions? Open an issue with [question] or ping on X @sanity1st. Thanks for co-aligning—let's lint the future!
